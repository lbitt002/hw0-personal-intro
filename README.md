# Personal Introductions

*This is the public posting of the assignment. See Piazza for the invite link to make your submission to the class repository.*

Create a new Markdown file in the master branch of this project named *YourGitHubUsername.md* to provide your introduction.  I've added my introduction ([weiglemc.md](weiglemc.md)) as an example for you.

To create a new file, click the 'Create new file' button.  Enter the name of your file with the `.md` extension to create a Markdown file.  More information about the Markdown markup language is available at https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/.  You can click the 'Preview' tab to see the results of your edits before you 'Commit' your changes.

In your introduction, provide the following information:
* Name
* MS or PhD
* Hometown or home country
* Are you taking this course on campus or online?
* Why you are taking this course and what do you expect to gain from it?
* What are your research or computing/technology interests?
* Share one or two interesting things about yourself so that your classmates can get to know you better.

Make sure that you've added a photo to your github.com profile.



**Due Date:** Your introduction is due before our first class meeting on Aug 27.  We will look at all of the entries in class.
